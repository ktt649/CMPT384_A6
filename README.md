# WWI-Bombing-Visualization
Data visualization project based on WWI bombing data

LIVE DEMO

Developed using D3 this project takes the dataset that can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/usaf/wwi-bombing-operations#THOR_WWI_Bombing_Operations.csv and creates a map visualization of the dataset.

The visualization allows users to see the locations of each of the allied bombing raids performed in WWI. While hovering over a datapoint the circle will enlarge. The radius of the circle is related to the payload dropped at that particular point. The user can click on a datapoint to gain more information about the partiuclar point, this information is displayed on the right pannel. After clicking, the bombing route will be displayed as a purple dashed-line on the map.

The bottom pannel serves two purposes. First, it is used as a legend with the color of the checkbox cooresponding to the bombing raid performed by that country. Secondly, it gives the user the ability to filter the dataset by each country.

Thank you for taking the time to see the demo of my project.
